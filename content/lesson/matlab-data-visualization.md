<p class="lead">MATLAB is mathematical computing software that combines an easy-to-use 
desktop environment with a powerful programming language. MATLAB can be used for data 
cleansing and processing, as well as data visualization. This tutorial will cover 
1. importing data from a variety of file types and formats, 2. data cleansing and 
manipulation, and 3. data visualization techniques. </p>

# <a name="downloading-data">Downloading the Data</a>

Throughout the tutorial we will be working with data from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES). The data file can be downloaded here: [nhanes_matlab.xlsx](https://workshops.somrc.virginia.edu/data/nhanes_matlab.xlsx).

### `readtable`

#### Creates a table by reading column oriented data from a file

```
T = readtable(filename)
```

`readtable` creates one variable in the table `T` for each column in the file `filename`.

Wholly numeric columns will be converted to a numeric array; a cell array will be generated 
from a column containing any non-numeric values.

| **Readable File Formats** | **File Extensions** |
| -----                     |  ------             |
| Delimited text files      | .txt, .dat, .csv    |
| Spreadsheet files         | .xls, .xlsb, .xlsx  |


#### Example

```
data = readtable('nhanes_matlab.xlsx');
```

While `readtable` is capable of reading Excel files, you will need to use `readmatrix` if you 
need to specify sheet names or a range of data. Both of these functions output a table.

## <a name="importing-multiple-files">Importing Data from Multiple Files</a>

### `datastore`

#### Read large collections of data

A datastore is simply a reference to a file or set of files. You tell MATLAB where to look 
for files with the `datastore` command.

#### Single File
```
ds = datastore(filename)
```

#### Multiple Files
```
ds = datastore(directory)
```

The datastore `ds` has many properties that you can modify so that MATLAB reads your data 
correctly (e.g. treating `-999` as a missing value instead of a numeric data point).

Datastores are also useful if you are working with such a large amount of data that you 
wouldn't be able to load it all into memory. With a datastore you can tell MATLAB to read 
in the data incrementally, whether it's file by file or in 100-line chunks (MATLAB reads data in 20,000 
line chunks by default).

To read in data using a datastore, use the `read` or `readall` commands.

#### Read data incrementally
```
data = read(ds);
```

#### Read all data referenced by datastore `ds`
```
data = readall(ds);
```

Check out the [MATLAB documentation on datastores](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/datastore.html) to learn more about customizing your 
data import.

#### Example

```
% Create datastore
ds = datastore('nhanes_matlab.xlsx');

% Set ReadSize property in ds to 50 so we only read in 50 lines at a time
ds.ReadSize = 50;

% Read in first 50 lines
data50 = read(ds);

% Read in next 50 lines
data100 = read(ds);

% Read in all data
data_all = readall(ds);
```

## <a name="importing-unstructured-data">Importing Unstructured Data</a>

Suppose you have an unstructured data file like the one below.

<img src="/images/matlab-dataviz-1.png" style="width:50%;height:50%"></img>

Even, though we understand how to read data formatted this way, MATLAB is unable to read 
data automatically if each line doesn't have the same columns. We can use MATLAB's lower 
level file import functions to read irregular data.

Using low-level file import requires three steps:

1. Open file (`fid = fopen(filename)`, fid stands for **f**ile **ID**)

2. Read data

3. Close file (`fclose(fid)`)

The first and last steps are pretty straightforward, so the rest of this section will 
focus on step 2. There are a couple ways we can read in the data.

### `fgetl`
#### Read line from file 

```
myLine = fgetl(fid)
```
Using in succession will allow you to continue reading the file line by line. Regardless of 
whether the data is numeric, the output of `fgetl` will be a string. This means you may have to 
parse and convert the data to the proper data type after import. You can learn more about 
this process from [MATLAB's documentation on string manipulation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/characters-and-strings.html).

### `textscan`
#### Read formatted data from file

```
myData = textscan(fid, formatSpec) 
```

`textscan` allows you to specify the format of a line of data up-front so that you don't have to 
manipulate strings unnecessarily. `textscan` also allows you to read multiple lines and to skip 
any columns you don't need. 

The output of `textscan` is a cell array (`myData`) where each cell contains the values from a 
single column. Each cell will contain a column vector (for numeric data) or column cell array (for non-numeric or mixed 
data).

`textscan` requires you to specify the format of your data in the variable `formatSpec`.
Below is a `formatSpec` for some example data.

<img src="/images/matlab-dataviz-2.png" style="height:50%;width:50%"></img>

```
% This dataset is part of your installation of MATLAB!

% fullfile is retrieving and the full file path to the dataset.
filename = fullfile(matlabroot, 'examples', 'matlab', 'scan1.dat');

% Open the file
fid = fopen(filename);

% Format spec: it's a string
formatSpec = '%{MM/dd/uuuu}D %s %f32 %d8 %u %f %f %s %f';

% Read the data into using textscan
myData = textscan(fid, formatSpec);

% Close the file
fclose(fid);
```

# <a name="data-cleansing">2. Data Cleansing</a>

## <a name="working-with-missing-data">Working with Missing Data</a>

When MATLAB imports data that has missing values for numeric variables, it replaces that 
instance with `NaN`, or **N**ot-**a**-**N**umber. This section discusses multiple ways you 
can handle missing data and NaNs.

### Omitting NaNs

Calculating stats on arrays that contain NaN results in another NaN. If we want to omit NaNs 
from our calculation, we can use the `'omitnan'` option.

#### Example: Calculating mean
```
avgIncome = mean(data.Income, 'omitnan');

```

Other functions that can use the `'omitnan'` option:

| Function Name | What It Does       |
| ---           | ---                |
| cov           | Covariance         |
| mean          | Mean               |
| median        | Median             |
| std           | Standard Deviation |
| var           | Variance           |

However, `max` and `min` omit NaNs by default, and adding the `'omitnan'` flag will yield 
unexpected results.

### Locating Missing Data and Deleting Incomplete Rows

#### `ismissing`
#### Find missing values in a table

```
TF = ismissing(A)
```
`ismissing` returns a logical array `TF` that is the same size as the table `A`. Values of `1` 
in `TF` correspond to missing values in `A` at the same location.

#### `any`
#### Find non-zero elements in an array

```
missingRows = any(TF, 2)
```
`any` returns a logical array `missingRows` that is the same length as the input array `TF`.
Values of `1` in `missingRows` correspond to rows in `TF` that contain a `1`. Because `1`s in `TF` 
correspond to missing values in our original table `A`, **values of 1 in `missingRows` also correspond 
to rows with missing data in `A`.**

We have the number `2` as the second input in `any`. This is because by default `any` looks for 
non-zero elements in a column. Since we want to look for non-zero elements in rows, we need to specify 
that with the `2`.

#### Logical Indexing
#### Remove rows with missing data

```
A(missingRows,:) = [];
```

Using our logical array `missingRows`, we can index into our table `A` and select all of the 
rows in A that have missing data. With the colon operator `:`, we can also select the data from all 
the columns in those rows. If we select that data in `A` and set it equal to empty brackets, that will 
remove all those rows from `A`.

#### Example
```
% Read in data as table
data = readtable('nhanes_matlab.xlsx');

% Find missing data
missing = ismissing(data);

% Find rows that have missing data
missingRows = any(missing, 2);

% Remove rows with missing data from table
data(missingRows,:) = [];
```

## <a name="categorical-data-set-operations">Categorical Data and Set Operations</a>

### `categorical`
#### Assigns a value to each of a finite set of discrete categories

Consider the cell array below.
```
mySet = {'low', 'medium', 'low', 'low', 'high', 'medium', 'low'};
```
As humans, we understand that the array contains values that fall into 3 distinct categories: 
'low', 'medium', and 'high'. MATLAB doesn't necessarily know this and will treat all seven items in the 
array as individual values. With the `categorical` function, we can tell MATLAB to treat values with 
the same string as part of a single category. The output of the `categorical` function is a 
categorical array the same size as the input array.

```
mySet = categorical(mySet);

categories(mySet)
```

With the `categories` command, we can find out the different categories in our categorical array. 
As expected, our three categories are 'low', 'medium', and 'high'.

We can convert the text variables in our table to categorical arrays one at a time with the categorical command.

```
% Reading the data into a table
data = readtable('nhanes_matlab.xlsx');

% Convert Gender variable to categorical array
data.Gender = categorical(data.Gender);
```

### `convertvars`
#### Batch convert table variables to categorical arrays

```
T2 = convertvars(T1, vars, datatype)
```

We can use `convertvars` to create a new table `T2` that converts all the variables in our table `T1` to our desired data 
type, in this case categorical arrays. We list the names of the variables we want to convert in 
the cell array `vars`.

#### Example
```
% Reading the data into a table
data = readtable('nhanes_matlab.xlsx');

% Convert text variables to categorical arrays
vars = {'Gender', 'Race'};
        
newdata = convertvars(data, vars, 'categorical');
```

We can replace `vars` with `@iscell` if we know we want to convert all cell arrays to in our 
table to categorical arrays.

```
newdata = convertvars(data, @iscell, 'categorical');
```

### Why Use Categorical Arrays?

* Several discrete data plot types require input data be categorical
* Use less memory
* `ismissing` is able to determine missing data in categorical arrays but not cell arrays
