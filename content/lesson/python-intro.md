<p class="lead">
Python is a general purpose programming language that has quickly become one of the most 
popular programming languages in data science and machine learning. This lesson is a great
starting point for those with little to no programming experience who are also interested
in learning basic programming concepts. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to 
perform math and create variables; use loops, logics, and conditionals; and write your own 
functions and import modules--all within the Python environment!
