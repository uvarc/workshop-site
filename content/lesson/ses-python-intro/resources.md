# Conclusion

Thank you for taking our course! Python has a huge user community and its use cases are vast. You can never know it all. Luckily, you don't need to. Because python is an open source language, there are tons of resources available to you via UVA and other places online. Use this page as a reference to some of the applicable ones to this course


# Resources

### UVA Specific Resources
