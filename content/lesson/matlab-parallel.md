## Workshop Overview

MATLAB is an integrated technical computing environment from the MathWorks that combines array-based numeric computation, advanced graphics and visualization, and a high-level programming language. Separately licensed toolboxes provide additional domain-specific functionality.

During this hands-on workshop, you will be introduced to parallel and distributed computing in MATLAB for speeding up your application and offloading work.  By working through common scenarios and workflows, you will gain an understanding of the parallel constructs in MATLAB, their capabilities, and some of the typical issues that arise when using them.

Workshop examples will vary in difficulty, starting from simple parallel usage concepts to more advanced techniques.  Attendees will be able to ask questions and receive feedback regarding workshop exercises.  Users will also have the opportunity to run MATLAB code on the Rivanna cluster if they have login accounts.

Highlights include:

 - Speeding up programs with parallel computing
 - Offloading computations and cluster computing
 - Working with large data sets
 - GPU Computing

Requirements:
MATLAB experience or basic programming or coding experience is suggested.  Cluster compute and Linux experience is not required for this workshop.
