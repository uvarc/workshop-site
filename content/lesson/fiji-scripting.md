This tutorial is an introduction to the scripting interface of the [Fiji](https://fiji.sc) application, an open-source and enhanced version of the popular ImageJ program used for scientific image processing.  Here you will learn how to write scripts for automated execution of image processing pipelines and batch processing of multiple image files in Fiji.

Step-by-step instructions are provided for developing scripts in Jython, an implementation of the popular Python language for Java platforms. Example scripts are provided for the Jython and BeanShell languages.


# Intro & Fiji Programming Tools {#intro-id}

## Installation {#installation-id}
Fiji is a stand-alone application that can be downloaded from the [Fiji website](https://fiji.sc/#download). It is available for Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux platforms.  

+ **MacOS X:** The Fiji application should be installed in the the user's home directory rather than the default `Applications` folder.
+ **Windows 7 & 10:** The Fiji application should be installed in the the user's home directory rather than the default `C:\Program Files` directory.
+ **Linux:** The Fiji application should be installed in a directory where the user has read, execution, and write permissions, e.g. the user's `home` directory.

**Example Scripts**
[Download examples](/scripts/fiji/fiji-example-scripts.zip).
<br>


## The Application Programming Interface (API) {#api-id}
Fiji and ImageJ are written in Java. The application programming interface (API) defines the various Java packages, classes, methods, and constants that a programmer can use for development of custom Fiji & ImageJ scripts. The API is well documented on these public sites:

+ ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/api/)
+ Fiji (https://javadoc.scijava.org/Fiji/)

Fiji provides convenient programming wrappers for these Java classes so you can write your scripts in:

+ ImageJ macro language: simple, slow, not very versatile
+ Jython:  Python syntax with a few limitations, easy to learn, very versatile
+ BeanShell:  Syntax similar to Java, versatile
+ Several others…

**Fiji provides a richer programming environment than ImageJ and it is recommended to use Fiji instead of ImageJ for any script development.**

Step-by-step instructions in this tutorial are provided for developing scripts in Jython. The download section contains scripts written in the Jython and BeanShell languages.

<br>


## The Script Editor {#script-editor-id}
To start the script editor in Fiji go to menu `File` > `New` > `Script…`.

![](/images/fiji-script-editor.png)

* The top pane provides the editor. Multiple scripts can be open at the same time and will show up as separate tabs.
* The bottom pane shows output (e.g. produced by print statements) and any errors encountered during script execution.

**Script editor menus:**

+ **File:** 		Load, save scripts
+ **Edit:**		Similar to word processor functionality (Copy, Paste, etc.)
+ **Language:**	Choose language your script is written in with syntax highlighting
+ **Templates:**	Example scripts
+ **Tools:**		Access to source code of a class in the ImageJ/Fiji package
+ **Tabs:**		Navigation aid in script

<br>

## The Macro Recorder {#macro-recorder-id}
In the Fiji menu, go to `Plugins` > `Macros…` > `Record`.

![](/images/fiji-macro-recorder.png)

+ The Macro Recorder logs all commands entered through the Fiji graphical user interface (GUI). It is useful to convert these GUI actions into script commands.
+ In the `Record` drop-down menu, select `BeanShell`.
+ Clicking the `Create` button copies the code to a new script in the [Script Editor](#script-editor-id).
+ **Keep the Recorder window open throughout this tutorial.**

## The Console Window {#console-id}
In the Fiji menu, go to `Window` > `Console`.

+ The Console window shows the output and logging information produced by running plugins and scripts.

<br>


# Jython {#jython-id}

Jython is an implementation of the Python 2.7 programming language designed to run on the Java platform.

+ Jython/Python are interpreter languages. The code is evaluated line-by-line when the script is run (executed). This is different from compiled languages.
+ Some Python packages (like numpy) are not available in Jython.  
+ Jython scripts can use ImageJ/Fiji packages and classes via specific `import` statements.
+ In Python many problems can be solved with less code than in other languages.  Still the code is easy to read. 

## Variables {#variables-id}
A variable is used to store values or references to other objects/functions in the computer's memory.

* Values are assigned to variables in statements with an `=`.
* The identifier to the left of `=` defines the variable name, the expression to the right of the `=`defines the value to be assigned to the variable.
* Variable names have to start with a letter and cannot contain any special characters, e.g. `?`, `,`, etc.. Variable names are case-sensitive, so `my_name` is not the same as `My_name` or `my_Name`.

Let's create five variables, `x`, `y`, `my_name`, `is_it_Monday`, and `my_list`.  

```
x = 10
y = 2.3
my_name = "Santa Claus"
is_it_Monday = False
my_list = [2,3,5,7,11]
```

* `x` is assigned an integer value of `10`.
* `y` is a float variable, i.e. a number with decimals.
* `my_name` is a assigned a sequence of characters, called a `string`. Strings are defined by enclosing single `'` or double `"` quotes.
* `is_it_Monday` is assigned a boolean value. A boolean can be either `True` or `False`.
* `my_list` contains a sequence of data elements, in this case integers. In Python/Jython, you can create lists containing elements with mixed types, even nested lists, e.g. `[1.0, 'abc', 1.2, "hello"]`.

<br>

## Conditionals: if Statements {#conditionals-id}

Often different blocks of code need to be executed depending on a specific condition.  This is achieved by using `if`, `elif`, `else` code blocks.

```
if <Boolean expression1>:
   statement(s)
elif <Boolean expression2>:
   statement(s)
else:
   statement(s)
```

**Example:**
```
x = 100
y = 200
if x < y:
    print "x is smaller than y."
elif x == y:
    print "x equals y"
else:
    print "x is larger than y"    
```

**Note:**

* The `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords need to start at the same indentation level. Each of these lines end with a `:`, signifying the beginning of a new code block.
* The statement(s) to be executed need to be indented by at least a single space relative to the `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords.
* The `elif` and `else` statements are optional. Multiple `elif` blocks can be placed between the `if` and `else` blocks.
* Any expression that evaluates to a boolean (`True` or `False`) can be used as conditional for the `if` and `elif` statements.
* An `elif` block is only executed if all preceding `if` and `elif` conditions evaluated to `False`, and the conditional expression in this `elif` statement evaluates to `True`.
* The `else` block is only executed if all preceding `if` and `elif` conditions evaluated to `False`.  
* The `==` is the operator to test for equality. Do not confuse it with `=`, which is used to assign values to variables.    

<br>

## Code Loops {#loops-id}

Like most languages, Python and Python offer loop constructs to repeatedly execute the same code block.

**For loops**:

`for` loops are executed a fixed number of iterations. It is possible to exit early but this must be added to the code.

```
for <item> in <iterator>:
    statement(s)
else:  # optional
    statement(s)
```

**Example:**
```
for i in range(20):
   print i
```

* The `else` clause is optional and only executed when the loop completes the iterator.
* The `for` and `else` keywords need to start at the same indentation levels. Each of these lines end with a `:`.
* The statement(s) to be executed need to be indented by at least a single space relative to the `for` and `else` keywords.


<br>


**While loops**:

`while` loops do not have a predetermined number of iterations. They terminate when some condition is evaluated as `False`.

```
while <Boolean expression>:
    statement(s)
else: # optional
    statement(s)
```

**Example:**
```
x = -20
y = -5
while (x<0 and y<0):
    print "x=", x, "y=", y
    x = x - y
    y = y + 1
else:
    print "Exited loop with: x:", x, ", y:", y
```

* The `else` clause is optional and executed when the loop completes the iterator.
* `break` and `continue` statements can be added inside the code loop to exit the loop early, or to skip to the next iteration, respectively.

## Functions {#functions-id}
A function is a code block that groups related statements that perform a specific task or job within a larger program.

* With functions, we can break down a program into a series of well-defined tasks which are easier to write and debug.
* Functions allow us to reuse code.
* Functions reduce "cut-and-paste" errors.  
* If your code performs a task more than once, write a function.

In Jython and Python this could look like this:

```
def add_values(value1, value2):
    result = value1 + value2
    return result
```

* The declaration of a function starts with the keyword `def` followed by the function's name (i.e. `add_values`) and a list of parameters (i.e. `(value1,value2)`).
* The content of the function is defined by the indented code block following the `def` function declaration.  Consistent indentation (with spaces) is required in order for the Interpreter to figure out what lines are part of this function.
* The `return` statement defines values that are passed to the code block that invoked execution of the function, i.e. the caller. If no `return` statement is defined, the function returns `None`.

Example for invocation of the function `add_values`:
```
sum = add_values(2.3, 4.1)
print sum
```

* In this example we are calling the function `add_values`, passing the numbers `2.3` and `4.0` as arguments.
* The function performs the operation on the passed arguments and the result is stored in our custom variable `sum`.

## Importing packages {#import-id}
Just like Python, Jython provides an easy way to get access to classes and functions that are defined in external packages, outside of your script.

* The `import` statement specifies the names of external packages, classes and functions your script wants to use (the `namespace`).
* The [ImageJ API documentation][imagej-api] provides the Java package names and classes.

Here's an example. Let's say we want to use the [ImageProcessor][imageprocessor] class in our Jython script.  The `ImageProcessor` class is defined in the `ij.process` Java package so the equivalent Jython `import` statement would look like this:

```
from ij.process import ImageProcessor
```

<br>

## Script Example {#jython-scripts-id}

Jython scripts are simple text files that use specific syntax and structure. **Jython scripts (or scripts in any other programing language) should not be edited in word processing programs like Microsoft Word which add invisible formatting characters that mess with programming language syntax.**

```
from ij import IJ

def print_info(imp):
    """This function prints basic image info."""
    print "\nTitle:", imp.getTitle() # print title

    # output image dimensions
    print "Width x Height:", imp.getWidth(), "x", imp.getHeight()

# Main code block
imp = IJ.getImage()
print_info(imp)    
```

* `import` statements define code that your script needs to work but that is organized in packages/modules outside of your current script. An overview of the standard Fiji/ImageJ packages can be found [here][imagej-api].
* Indentation levels define code blocks, e.g. conditionals, code loops, functions.
* The `def` keyword defines the beginning of a function, followed by the function's name and argument list. The content of the function is defined by the indented code block following the `def` function declaration.
* Empty lines are ignored by the interpreter but can improve readability of the code.
* The `#` defines a comment. All characters following a `#` on that line are ignored by the code interpreter.  
* Text between a pair of triple quotes `"""` defines a special comment type, called doc string, that is used to annotate an entire program or function.

<br>

# Fiji Scripts in Jython {#fiji-id}

## Images in Fiji: ImagePlus, ImageStack, ImageProcessor {#image-handling-id}

+ An [ImagePlus][imageplus] object contains an [ImageProcessor][imageprocessor] (2D image) or an [ImageStack][imagestack] (3D, 4D or 5D image). It is used to show the image in a window and also includes metadata (e.g. spatial calibration, the directory/file where it was read from, acquisition info, etc.).
+ The [ImageProcessor][imageprocessor] contains the pixel data (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit float, or RGB) of the 2D image and some basic methods to manipulate it.
+ An [ImageStack][imagestack] is a group of [ImageProcessors][imageprocessor] of the same type and size. ImageStack allows the implementation of multi-dimensional images, e.g. with `x`, `y`, `z`, `time`, and `channel` axes.

<br>

## Get Current Image {#current-image-id}
In **Fiji**, go to `File` > `Open Samples` > `Blobs`.

```
from ij import IJ                       # find the IJ class

imp = IJ.getImage()                     # get active Image
print "\nTitle:", imp.getTitle()        # output image title

# output image dimensions
print "Width x Height:", imp.getWidth(), "x", imp.getHeight()
```

* The IJ.getImage() command retrieves the image from the currently active image window in Fiji.  We assign the returned [ImagePlus][imageplus] object to the variable `imp`.
* The ImagePlus class provides numerous methods that can be accessed via the `imp` object instance, e.g. `imp.getTitle()`, `imp.getWidth()`, `imp.getHeight()`, etc.
* The `print` statement outputs Strings and values in the [Script Editors](#script-editor-id) console pane.

**Create the script:**

In the **Fiji Script Editor**, go through these steps:

1. Create a new file (`File` > `New`).
2. Go to `Language` and select `Python`.
3. Copy the script above into the script editor.
4. Go to `File` > `Save as...` and save the file as `Get_Image.py`.
5. Click the `Run` button.

**Output:**
```
Started Get_Image.py at Tue Jun 04 00:50:07 EDT 2019

Title: blobs.gif
Width x Height: 256 x 254
```

<br>

## Image Dimensions {#image-dimensions-id}

Fiji and ImageJ can handle multi-dimensional images, e.g. volumetric images or time-lapse series, up to five dimensions. Each image ([ImagePlus][#imageplus] object) has at least two dimensions, i.e. width (x-axis) and height (y-axis). In addition, ImagePlus object can have multiple color channels, z-focal planes (called slices), and/or timepoints (called frames). Lastly, images can have different pixel encodings, e.g. 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, RGB that define an image's dynamic range (e.g. number of distinct intensity values per pixel) and color representation.

The ImagePlus class provides convenient methods to get this information.

```
from ij import IJ

imp = IJ.getImage()
width = imp.getWidth()            # get number of pixels along x-axis
height = imp.getHeight()          # get number of pixels along y-axis
channel_no = imp.getNChannels()   # get number of channels
slice_no = imp.getNSlices()       # get number of slices
frame_no = imp.getNFrames()       # get number of frames

bitdepth = imp.getBitDepth()      # bits per pixel
bpp = imp.getBytesPerPixel()      # bytes per pixel (there are 8 bits in a byte)    
```

<br>

## Image calibration {#image-calibration-id}

Many image formats allow inclusion of image annotations (metadata) in addition to the pixel data. An important piece of information is the spatial pixel calibration, e.g. the definition of pixel size in real-world physical units. For example, a pixel may correspond to 200 nanometer in x-y dimension.

Let's assume that we have a variable `imp` as reference to an [ImagePlus][#imageplus] object. We can get and set an image's calibration with the following ImagePlus class methods:

**Get copy of image calibration**
```
calibration = imp.getCalibration().copy()
```

**Set image calibration**
```
new_imp.setCalibration(calibration)
```

<br>

## Creating a New Image {#new-image-id}

New images can be created by initializing an [ImagePlus][imageplus] object with an [ImageProcessor][imageprocessor] object instance.  The following ImageProcessor subclasses can be used, depending on bit-depth and color mode of the desired image.

| ImageProcessor subclass | Mode | bits/pixel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [ByteProcessor][byteprocessor] | grayscale | 8-bit int |
| [ShortProcessor][shortprocessor] | grayscale | 16-bit int |
| [FloatProcessor][floatprocessor] | grayscale |32-bit float |
| [ColorProcessor][colorprocessor] | color | 8-bit int per channel |

<br>

**Example**
```
from ij.process import ByteProcessor, ShortProcessor,  \
                                     FloatProcessor, ColorProcessor
from ij import ImagePlus

width = 200                                  # in pixel
height = 100                                 # in pixel
bp = ByteProcessor(width, height)            # create ImageProcessor
imp_bp = ImagePlus("New 8-bit image", bp)    # create ImagePlus with specific title and ImageProcessor object
imp_bp.show()                                # show image window

sp = ShortProcessor(width, height)
imp_sp = ImagePlus("New 16-bit image", sp)
imp_sp.show()

fp = FloatProcessor(width, height)
imp_fp = ImagePlus("New 32-bit image", fp)
imp_fp.show()

cp = ColorProcessor(width, height)
imp_cp = ImagePlus("New RGB image", cp)
imp_cp.show()
```

This script creates four new images, each with 200 x 100 pixels but with different pixel encodings. Take a look at each image window's header and note the differences.

![](/images/fiji-newimages.png)

* Pixel encoding (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, RGB).
* Memory footprint in kilobytes (20K, 39K, 78K, 78K).

<br>

## Duplicating an Image {#image-duplication-id}

The [Duplicator][duplicator] class provides a convenient way to create an exact copy of an existing ImagePlus object.

```
from ij import IJ
from ij.plugin import Duplicator

imp = IJ.getImage()
copied_imp = Duplicator().run(imp)
copied_imp.show()
```

Note that the duplicated image will be named `DUP_<original_title>`. You can change the title with the `setTitle(string)` method.
```
copied_imp.setTitle("Perfect copy")
```

<br>

## Opening and Saving Image Files {#image-io-id}

**Open Images**

Fiji can read many different image file formats. This versatility is now provided via the integrated [Bio-Formats plugin][bioformats].

| Class/Method | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| IJ.open() |	interactive dialog |
| IJ.openImage() | non-interactive, using default image display |
| loci.formats.ImageReader | non-interactive, configurable image display |

<br>

**Save Images**

Fiji can also save image files in various common formats, including TIF, OME-TIF, BMP, PNG, JPEG, AVI, etc.).

| Class/Method | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| ij.io.FileSaver | interactive dialog |
| IJ.saveAs () | non-interactive, simple image writer (TIF, JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.) |
| loci.formats.ImageWriter | non-interactive, advanced with many formats |

<br>

**Interactive Image Opening and Saving (with Dialog)**
```
from ij import IJ
from ij.io import FileSaver
```

# Open file (interactive dialog)
```
imp = IJ.open()
imp = IJ.getImage()
imp.setTitle("copy.tif")
```

# Save file in original format (interactive dialog)
```
fs = FileSaver(imp)
fs.save()        # could also use fs.saveAsTiff(), fs.saveAsPng(), etc.
```

<br>

**Non-interactive Image Opening and Saving (without Dialog)**
```
from ij import IJ
import os
from os import path

# Open file from URL or storage device (non-interactive)
filesource = "http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/images/blobs.gif"
imp = IJ.openImage(filesource)
imp.show()

# Create new output directories and filename
homedir = path.expanduser("~")				# home directory
outputdir = path.join(homedir, "workshop", "images")	# full dir path
print outputdir
if not path.isdir(outputdir):			
    os.makedirs(outputdir)

# Save file as .tif (non-interactive)
outputfile = os.path.join(outputdir, "blobs-copy.tif")
IJ.saveAs(imp, "tiff", outputfile)
print "Saved file:", outputfile
```

Check the output in the console window. The image should have been saved to the `workshop/images` subdirectory in your `home` directory.
**If you cannot find your saved file, try this:**

* Click on the `blobs-copy.tif` image window,
* Go to `Image` > `Show Info…`.
* View path entry in `Info for blobs-copy.tif` window.

**Note that file paths use `\` on Windows but `/` on Linux and OSX platforms. Avoid hardcoding the `\` or `/` and use [os.path][ospath] functions to create platform appropriate path names.**

<br>

## IJ.run {#ij-run-id}

The `IJ.run` command can be used to execute many of the commands available through the Fiji graphical user interface.

Basic syntax: `IJ.run(image, command, option)`

* **image**	: reference to ImagePlus object
* **command**	: String
* **option** : String, in some cases just `""` (empty String)

The [Macro Recorder](#macro-recorder-id) is an excellent tool to convert a function accessible via the Fiji menu into an `IJ.run` statement. Let's try it.

**Record**

1. Ensure that the [Macro Recorder](#macro-recorder-id) window is open.  If not, go to `Plugins` > `Macro` > `Recorder`.
2. In the Recorder window’s `Record` drop-down menu, select `BeanShell`.
3. In the Recorder window select and remove any code.
4. In Fiji, go to `File` > `Open Samples` > `Boats`
5. Go to `Process` > `Filters` > `Gaussian Blur`, a dialog will pop up:
    * Enter a `Sigma value` of `5`.
    * Click `Ok`.
6. Go to `File` > `Save As…` > `Tiff`.
7. Browse to your `workshop/images` directory (if it does not exist yet, create it), use `blurry_boats.tif` as file name  and click `Save`.
8. In the Recorder window, click `Create`. This should bring up the [Script Editor](#script-editor-id) window with a new script file containing the code copied from the Recorder. **If you see more than three lines of code, remove everything that starts before `imp = IJ.openImage(….`.**

**Convert to Jython script**

1. In the [Script Editor](#script-editor-id) , go to `Language`, and select `Python`.
2. Insert an `from ij import IJ` statement at the top of the script.
3. Remove semicolons (`;`) at the end of the last three lines so your script looks like this (ignore the file path; yours will be different):
```
from ij import IJ

imp = IJ.openImage("http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/images/boats.gif")
IJ.run(imp, "Gaussian Blur...", "sigma=5")
IJ.saveAs(imp, "Tiff", "/Users/mst3k/blurry_boats.tif")
```
4. Save your script as `IJ_Run.py`. Close all image windows.
5. Run the script.

Check your `workshop/images` directory for the `blurry_boats.tif` file.

<br>

## Working with ImageStack {#imagestack-id}

In Fiji, go to `File` > `Open Samples` > `Mitosis`. This image has the following dimensions:

* 2 Channels
* 5 Focal Planes (Slices, Z)
* 51 Timepoints (Frames)

The multi-dimensional image (represented by an [ImagePlus][imageplus] object `imp`) contains an [ImageStack][imagestack] object to manage the different image planes. An ImageStack contains a group of [ImageProcessors][imageprocessor] of the same type and size.

The ImageStack object of an ImagePlus object (`imp`) can be retrieved like so:
```
stack = imp.getStack()
```

The following code provides a reference to the ImageProcessor for a particular channel, slice, and frame in the `imp` ImagePlus object:
```
index = imp.getStackIndex(channel_no, slice_no, frame_no)
stack = imp.getStack()
ip = stack.getProcessor(index)
```

Conversely, we can replace an ImageProcessor in an ImageStack (referenced by the `stack` variable) like so:
```
stack.setProcessor(new_ip, index)     # provide new ImageProcessor object, and stack position to place it
```

**Important:** The new ImageProcessor object has to be of the same type, width, and height as all the other ImageProcessors in the stack.

<br>

## Regions-of-Interest (ROIs) {#rois-id}

[ROIs][roi] define groups of pixels in an image. An ROI can be used to:

* Measure pixel values
* Change pixel values
* Mark image regions in non-destructive overlays (without changing pixel values)

ROI Types (classes):

* Roi			
* Line			
* OvalRoi		
* PolygonRoi
* ShapeRoi
* TextRoi
* ImageRoi

ROIs can be managed directly or through the [RoiManager](#roi-manager-id) class.

### ROI: Cropping an Image {#roi-crop-id}

In Fiji, go to `File` > `Open` > `Samples` > `Clown`

```
from ij.gui import Roi
from ij import IJ
from ij.plugin import Duplicator

# get current image
imp = IJ.getImage()

# create rectangular ROI centered in image
rel_size = 0.5					# 0.0 < rel_size < 1.0
width = int(rel_size * imp.getWidth())
height = int(rel_size * imp.getHeight())
top_left_x = int(0.5 * (imp.getWidth() - width))
top_left_y = int(0.5 * (imp.getHeight()- height))
roi = Roi(top_left_x, top_left_y, width, height)

# copy image, set ROI on copied image, crop, set title and show image
cropped_imp = Duplicator().run(imp)
cropped_imp.setRoi(roi)
IJ.run(cropped_imp, "Crop", "")		# modifies passed ImagePlus object!
cropped_imp.setTitle('Cropped')
cropped_imp.show()
```

Run the script in the [Script Editor](#script-editor-id).

### Fill ROI with a Given Value {#roi-fill-id}

```
from ij import IJ, ImagePlus  
from ij.process import FloatProcessor  
from array import zeros  
from random import random  
from ij.gui import Roi, OvalRoi  

# Create a new ImagePlus filled with noise  
width = 1024  
height = 1024  
pixels = zeros('f', width * height)  
for i in xrange(len(pixels)):  
    pixels[i] = random()  
fp = FloatProcessor(width, height, pixels)  
imp = ImagePlus("Random", fp)  

# Fill a rectangular region of interest with a value of 2.0  
roi = Roi(40, 100, 400, 300)  
fp.setRoi(roi)  
fp.setValue(2.0)  
fp.fill()  

# Fill a oval region of interest with a value of -2.0  
oroi = OvalRoi(500, 300, 150, 550)  
fp.setRoi(oroi)  
fp.setValue(-2.0)  
fp.fill(oroi.getMask())  # Attention! Required for non-rectangular ROIs  

imp.show()
```

### Changing ROI Properties {#roi-properties-id}

The appearance of an [ROI][roi] object (`roi`) can be changed.

**Border [Color][color]**
```
from java.awt import Color
roi.setStrokeColor(Color.RED)
```

**Border Width**
```
roi.setStrokeWidth(2.0)
```

**Fill [Color][color]**
```
from java.awt import Color
roi.setFillColor(Color.YELLOW)
```

### Set ROI Position {#roi-set-id}

The positioning of an ROI object (`roi`) can be set for a specific channel, slice, frame in a given image (`imp`) with multi-dimensional [ImageStack][imagestack].

```
index = imp.getStackIndex(channelNo, sliceNo, frameNo)
roi.setPosition(index)
```

**Note:** If index is 0 (default), the Roi applies to all image planes in the stack.

## Particle Analysis {#particle-analysis-id}

1. In the [Macro Recorder](#macro-recorder-id) window’s `Record` drop-down menu, select `BeanShell`. Remove any code.
2. In Fiji, go to `File` > `Open Samples` > `Blobs`
3. Go to `Process` > `Filters` > `Median…`
    * Set `Radius` : 2
    * Click `Ok`.
4. Go to `Process` > `Binary` > `Options…`
    * Check `Black background` box.
    * Click `OK`.
5. Go to `Image` > `Adjust Threshold…`
    * Select `Default` and `Red` in drop-down menu
    * Uncheck `Dark background` box.  
    * Click `Apply`.
6. Go to `Process` > `Binary` > `Watershed`
7. Go to `Analyze` > `Set Measurements`
    * Select options as shown.
    * Click `Ok`.
8. Go to `Analyze` > `Analyze Particles…`
    * Select options as shown.
    * Click `Ok`.

![](/images/fiji-particle-analysis.png)

Convert the Macro recordings into a Python script, remember to do the following in the [Script Editor](#script-editor-id):

* In the Script Editor, go to `Language`, and select `Python`.
* Insert an `import` statement at the top the script
* Remove semicolons (`;`) at the end of the lines.

The script should look like this:
```
from ij import IJ

imp = IJ.openImage("http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/images/blobs.gif")
IJ.run(imp, "Median...", "radius=2")
IJ.run(imp, "Options...", "iterations=1 count=1 black")
IJ.setAutoThreshold(imp, "Default")
IJ.run(imp, "Convert to Mask", "")
IJ.run(imp, "Watershed", "")
IJ.run(imp, "Set Measurements...", "area mean min centroid integrated display redirect=None decimal=3")
IJ.run(imp, "Analyze Particles...", "size=0-Infinity display exclude clear summarize add")
imp.show()
```

Save the script as `Blob_Analysis.py`, and run the script.

You should see the following results tables.

![](/images/fiji-particle-analysis-results.png)

<br>


## RoiManager {#roi-manager-id}

The [RoiManager][roi-manager] class implements the `Analyze` > `Tools` > `ROI Manager` function. The Particle Analyzer can also use the Roi Manager to store ROIs identified during the analysis, see [Particle Analysis](#particle-analysis-id).

**Using the RoiManager class in scripts:**

Get reference to system default instance
```
from ij.plugin.frame import RoiManager
rm = RoiManager.getInstance2()
```
<br>
Get number of ROIs managed by RoiManager
```
count = rm.getCount()
```
<br>
Get all ROIs as a list
```
rois = rm.getAllRoisAsArray()
```
<br>
Get specific ROI at specific index position
```
roi = rm.getRoi(index)
```
<br>
Remove all ROIs
```
rm.reset()
```
<br>
Add ROI
```
roi = OvalRoi(100, 150, 50, 50)
rm.addRoi(roi)
```
<br>
Run operation on ROI: combine, select, save, open, etc.
```
rm.runCommand(command_string)
```

<br>

## ImageStatistics {#imagestats-id}

The [ImageStatistics][imagestats] class provides access to pixel-based statistics, including the histogram, of an entire image or ROI selection in an image.

**Common statements:**

Define measurement options: bitwise OR combination of constants
```
from ij.process import ImageStatistics as IS
options = IS.MEAN | IS.AREA | IS.STD_DEV  # many others
```
<br>
Measure entire image (imp)
```
imp.setRoi(null)   # remove any ROI from image
stats = imp.getStatistics()
```
<br>
Measure particular ROI (roi) in image (imp)
```
imp.setRoi(roi)
stats = imp.getStatistics()
```
<br>
Get histogram for image (imp) as a list of intensity counts:
```
stats = imp.getStatistics()
histo_values = stats.getHistogram()
```

<br>

## ResultsTable {#resultstable-id}

The [ResultsTable][resultstable] class is used for storing measurement results and strings as columns of values.

**Common statements:**

Get default table used by `Analyze` > `Measure`
```
from ij.measure import ResultsTable
rt = ResultsTable.getResultsTable()
```
<br>
Create new empty table
```
rt = ResultsTable()
```
<br>
Show table with title. The title `Results` is reserved for default table for `Analyze` > `Measure`.
```
rt.show("My Results")	# passed argument becomes table title
```
<br>
Get number of table rows
```
rt.getCount()
```
<br>
Get list of float values in column (by column header)
```
col_index = rt.getColumnIndex("Area")
rt.getColumn(col_index)
```
<br>
Add value to specific column in last row
```
rt.addValue("Area", 23.0)
```
<br>
Delete column
```
rt.deleteColumn("Area")
```
<br>
Delete row (by row index)
```
rt.deleteRow(row_index)
```

<br>

## Custom Dialog Windows: Collecting User Input {#dialogs-id}

Custom language agnostic dialogs can be created using the [SciJava@Parameter][scijava-params] annotation.

* Script parameters are a feature of ImageJ2; they will work in Fiji but will not work in plain ImageJ1.
* Basic Syntax:
    * Parameter declarations begin with `#@`.  Each such line contains a single parameter declaration or script directive and nothing else.
    * `#@ Type variableName` will declare an input of the indicated type, assigned to the specified name. The use of a space between #@ and Type is encouraged, but not required.
    * `#@output Type outputName` will declare the variable of the specified name as an output parameter with the given type. The Type parameter is optional, as the output will be treated as Object be default. (For the output directive and other script directives, no space is allowed between `#@` and the directive.)

| Data type	| Widget type	| Available styles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| boolean / Boolean	| checkbox | |
| byte / short / int / long	| numeric field	| slider / spinner / scroll bar |
| Byte / Short / Integer / Long	| numeric field	| slider / spinner / scroll bar |
| Float	| numeric field	| slider / spinner / scroll bar |
| BigInteger / BigDecimal	| numeric field	| slider / spinner / scroll bar |
| char / Character / String	|text field	| text field / text area / password |
| Dataset | ImagePlus	(>=2 images) triggers a dropdown list | |
| ColorRGB | color chooser | |
| Date | date chooser | |
| File | file chooser	| open / save / file / directory / extensions |
Source: https://imagej.net/Script_Parameters

**Example:**
```
# @String(label="Please enter your name",description="Name field") name
# @OUTPUT String greeting

greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!"
```

When you run the script, a dialog will pop up asking for your input. Type in a name (any character sequence) and click `OK`. The output message will be shown in a separate window.

## Batch Processing of Image Files {#batch-processing-id}

Often we want to apply the same image processing method to a set of images.

* It is convenient to organize such image files into a single directory or group of directories.
* We already created a series of images and saved them in the workshop/images directory.  Let’s produce a simple batch processing script that applies a Gaussian filter to all images in that directory.

**Simple Template:**
```
# @ File (label="Input directory", style="directory") inputdir
# @ File (label="Output directory", style="directory") outputdir

from ij import IJ
import os
from os import path

def process_file(f):
    print "Processing", f
    imp = IJ.openImage(f)
    IJ.run(imp, "Gaussian Blur...", "sigma=2");
    return imp

def save_as_tif(directory, image):
    title = image.getTitle().split(".")[0] + "-blurred.tif"
    outputfile = path.join(outputdir, title)
    IJ.saveAs(image, "TIFF", outputfile)
    print "Saved", outputfile

# Main code
inputdir = str(inputdir)
outputdir = str(outputdir)
if not path.isdir(inputdir):
    print inputdir, " is does not exist or is not a directory."
else:
    if not path.isdir(outputdir):
        os.makedirs(outputdir)
    filenames = os.listdir(inputdir)
    tif_files = [f for f in filenames if f.split(".")[-1] == "tif"]
    for tif_file in tif_files:
        fullpath = path.join(inputdir, tif_file)
        imp = process_file(fullpath)
        save_as_tif(outputdir, imp)
    print "Done.\n"
```

<br>

# Image Management with OMERO

OMERO is image management software that allows you to organize, view, annotate, analyze, and
share your data from a single centralized database. With OMERO, you and your collaborators
can access your images from any computer without having to download the images directly to
your machine.

Images in OMERO can be manipulated and viewed interactively through desktop and web clients, or through scripting interfaces for Python, Java, Matlab, and Fiji/ImageJ.

For more details, review the [OMERO tutorial](/lesson/omero).

**Setting up an example Dataset in OMERO**

1. Open a webbrowser and go to http://omero.hpc.virginia.edu. Login to the OMERO web interface as described [here](/lesson/omero/#using-omero-web).

    * Username: your computing ID
    * Password: your computing ID (you can change this after your first login)

2. Let's create a new empty dataset. Click on the green folder icon in the top left corner right below your Name. Name it `Mitosis`. After the dataset is generated, your user interface should look like this:
    ![](/images/fiji-omero-dataset.png)

4. Click on the `Mitosis` dataset icon and take note of the `Dataset ID` shown in the sidebar on the right side of the window. We need this ID when we run our scripts.


## Saving Images to the OMERO database

Let's try to export an Image from Fiji to OMERO.

### Single Images

1. Go back to Fiji and then to `File` --> `Open Samples` --> `Blobs`.

2. Go back to the Fiji Script Editor and open the `Omero_Open.py file`.
```
from ij import IJ

imp = IJ.getImage()
IJ.run(imp, "OMERO... ", "")
```

3. Run the script. The **Eport to OMERO** dialog window will open. Enter the following values:

    * **Server**: omero.hpc.virginia.edu.
    * **Port:** 4064
    * **User:** Your computing ID
    * **Password:** Your OMERO password
    * **OMERO Dataset ID:** Enter the ID for the `Mitosis` dataset that you created in the OMERO web interface.
    * Check the **Upload new image** box.

    Click `OK`.

    If you see an error, make sure you entered the correct password and Dataset ID.

4. Go to the OMERO website and refresh the page. Double click on the `Mitosis` dataset icon to expand it. Yo should see the blob.gif image.

### Batch Processing

Scripting provides a convenient way to automatically export many images at once. For this exercise we utilize the output produced by the `Split_Stack.py` script.  We will take the `Simple_Batch` script as a template and modify it so that the create TIF image files are directly exported to OMERO instead of saving them to our local disk.

The modified script can be found as `Omero_batch_save.py` in the downloaded example folder.

```
# @ File (label="Input directory", style="directory") inputdir
# @ Float (label="Gaussian blur radius", value=2.0) radius
# @ String (label="Omero User") user_id
# @ String (label="Omero Password", style="password") password
# @ String (label="Omero Server", value="omero.hpc.virginia.edu") host
# @ Integer (label="Omero Port", value=4064) server_port
# @ Integer (label="Omero Dataset ID", value=69) data_id

from ij import IJ
import os
from os import path

def process_file(f, radius):
    """Opens a file and applies a Gaussian filter."""
    print "Processing", f
    imp = IJ.openImage(f)
    IJ.run(imp, "Gaussian Blur...", "sigma=%s" % str(radius));
    return imp


# Main code
basecommand = "server=%s " % host
basecommand+= "port=%s " % server_port
basecommand+= "user=%s " % user_id
basecommand+= "password=%s " % password
basecommand+= "datasetid=%d " % data_id
basecommand+= "uploadimage=true uploadtables=false uploadrois=false updaterois=false tablenames= "

inputdir = str(inputdir)
if not path.isdir(inputdir):
    print inputdir, " does not exist or is not a directory."
else:
    filenames = os.listdir(inputdir)
    tif_files = [f for f in filenames if f.split(".")[-1] == "tif"]		# only .tif files
    for tif_file in tif_files:
        fullpath = path.join(inputdir, tif_file)
        imp = process_file(fullpath, radius)
        # need to show image for OMERO to pick it up
        imp.show()
        # export to OMERO
        IJ.run(imp, "OMERO... ", basecommand+"image=%s" % imp.getTitle())
        #ignore changes & close
        imp.changes=False
        imp.close()
        #save_as_tif(outputdir, imp)
print "Done.\n"
```

The key changes to the script are:

* Lines 1-7: collect OMERO connection info and Gaussian Blur parameter.
* Removal of the `save_as_tif` function
* creation of the `basecommand` string variable that defines the OMERO connection image export parameters.
* `IJ.run(imp, "OMERO... ", basecommand+"image=%s" % imp.getTitle())` to export a single image to OMERO.
<br>

1. Run the `Omero_batch_save.py` file.

2. A dialog window will appear. Enter the following values:

    * **Input directory:** Browse to the directory that has the mitosis_xx..tif images produced by the `Split_stack.py` script.
    * **Gaussian Blur:** Enter a number between 1.0 and 5.0.
    * **Omero User:** Your computing ID
    * **Omero Password:** Your OMERO Password
    * **Omero Server:** omero.hpc.virginia.edu
    * **Omero Port:** 4064
    * **Omero Dataset:** Enter the ID for the `Mitosis` dataset that you created in the OMERO web interface.

    Click `OK`.

4. The images should open and close one after another. If you receive any error messages, make sure that you entered the correct password and dataset ID.

5. Go the OMERO web interface and refresh the page. Expand the `Mitosis` dataset icon and view the new content of your dataset.

6. In the top left area of the browser window, click on your name next to the `omero-demo` field. In the `MyGroups` drop-down go to `omer-demo` and select `All members`. Now you should be able to see the datasets and image uploaded by your peers.

**Note that you can see datasets and images of other members in the `omero-demo` group but you can only manipulate (i.e. delete) your own datasets and images.**

### Retrieving Images from the OMERO database

After exporting images to OMERO, let's try to download images from the database.

1. In the OMERO web interface, click on any image in your `Mitosis` dataset and note the Image ID displayed in the sidebar on the right side. **Image retrieval relies on these unique image identifiers**.

2. Go back to the Fiji Script Editor and open the `Omero_open.py` script.

3. Run the script. A dialog window will open; enter these values:

    * **Omero User:** Your computing ID
    * **Omero Password:** Your OMERO Password
    * **Omero Server:** omero.hpc.virginia.edu
    * **Omero Port:** 4064
    * **Omero Group ID:** This is the ID for the `omero-demo` group.
    * **Image ID:** Enter the ID for an image that is part of your `Mitosis` dataset.

The script consists of the these core blocks:

* Lines 1-6 define user input to connect to OMERO.
* Lines 11-17 define a `command` variable that specifies OMERO connection and image parameters.
* Line 18 executes the OMERO importer plugin that retrieves the image.

```
# @ String (label="Omero User") user
# @ String (label="Omero Password", style="password") pwd
# @ String (label="Omero Server", value="omero.hpc.virginia.edu") server
# @ Integer (label="Omero Port", value=4064) server_port
# @ Integer (label="Omero Group ID", value=53) omero_group_id
# @ Integer (label="Image ID", value=2014) image_id

from ij import IJ

# Main code
command="location=[OMERO] open=[omero:"
command+="server=%s\n" % server
command+="user=%s\n" % user
command+="port=%s\n" % server_port
command+="pass=%s\n" % pwd
command+="groupID=%s\n" % omero_group_id
command+="iid=%s]" % image_id
IJ.runPlugIn("loci.plugins.LociImporter", command)
```

# Installing Scripts as Plugins {#install-plugins-id}

Once you have completed script development, you can install the script in Fiji.  It will show up as a selectable entry in the `Plugins` menu.

* **Note:** Your script name needs to include at least one underscore (`_`). Example: `Basic_Crop.py`

There are two install options:

* **Option A) Manual process:**
    1. Copy the script to the `plugins` directory in your Fiji install tree. You can create a subdirectory in `plugins` (e.g. plugins/workshop) and place your script there if you like to group related scripts.
* **Option B) Fiji installer:**
    1. In Fiji, go to `Plugins` > `Install…`.
    2. In the first pop-up dialog browse to and select the script. Click `Open`.  
    3. In the second dialog window,  select the plugins directory (or a subdirectory within plugins) to where the script should be installed. Click `Save`.

After installing the script as plugin, restart Fiji.

Go to `File` > `Plugins` and verify that the script is available.  The `_` and file extension are stripped from the plugin name. Example: `Basic_Crop.py` is installed as `Basic Crop`

# Exercises {#exercises-id}

## Beginner {#beginner-ex-id}

**Project 1:** Modify the [Get Current Image example script](#current-image-id) to print the number of channels, number of focal planes (z), and number of timepoints. Open images of your choice from `Fiji` > `Open Samples` and compare the output when running the script.

**Project 2:** Open the [Macro Recorder](#macro-recorder-id), delete any code in the recorder pane. Record the following steps and convert the macro recording into Jython script. [Hint: IJ.run](#ij-run-id)

1. Go to `File` > `Open Samples` > `Fluorescent Cells`.
2. Split the channels (Image > Color > Split Channels).
3. Merge the channels again as `Composite` image, but swap the red and green channel.

**Project 3:** Implement the [crop ROI example script](#roi-crop-id) with functions.

```

<br>

## Expert {#expert-ex-id}

**Project 8:**  Modify the processing function in [Batch Processing example script](#batch-processing-id) to apply a median filter to a circular shaped ROI in the center of the image. The ROI diameter should be half of the width or height (whichever is smaller) of the image. The radius of the median filter should be requested from the user. [Hint: Setting ROI](#roi-set-id), [Hint: Recording filter functions](#ij-run-id), [Hint: Custom Dialog Windows](#dialogs-id)

**Project 9:** Let’s create a script that performs the following operations on a multi-dimensional ImageStack:

* Extract the central focal image planes of the last channel for all timepoints.
* Save each extracted image plane as a separate .tif image file in a designated directory.
* The pixel size calibration of the original image should be retained in each saved image plane.

<br>
```
from ij import IJ
from ij import ImagePlus
import os
from os import path

imp = IJ.openImage("http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/images/Spindly-GFP.zip")

channel_no = imp.getNChannels()              # last channel
slice_no = 1 + imp.getNSlices() // 2         # integer division to get center slice
stack = imp.getStack()                       # get ImageStack object
calibration = imp.getCalibration().copy()    # get pixel calibration

# create output dir workshop/images in home directory if it does not exist
outputdir = path.join(path.expanduser("~"), "workshop", "images")
print outputdir
if not path.isdir(outputdir):
    os.makedirs(outputdir)

# iterate over all frames and save central slice of last channel
for frame_no in range(1, imp.getNFrames() + 1):
    stack_index = imp.getStackIndex(channel_no, slice_no, frame_no)
    ip = stack.getProcessor(stack_index)

    # remove extension from image title and add frame no as suffix
    title = imp.getTitle().split(".")[0] + "-" + str(frame_no)
    single_imp = ImagePlus(title, ip)
    single_imp.setCalibration(calibration)

    # create file name with absolute path (incl directory name) and save
    outputfile = path.join(outputdir, title)
    IJ.saveAs(single_imp, "Tiff", outputfile)
```

**Project 10:** Modify Project 9 to include the following features:

* Apply either a Gaussian or Median filter of choosable radius to the extracted image plane.
* Downsample the extracted image plane by a certain factor (see next instruction). Pay to attention to where to place that command in relation to the `setCalibration()` command.
* Include a custom dialog that
    * lets the user choose the filter mode ("Gaussian Blur..." or "Median...") and filter radius (sigma for Gaussian),
    * lets the user to specify the downsampling fraction (0 < fraction <= 1.0). 1.0 would imply no downsampling. Hint: `Image` > `Adjust` > `Size`.
